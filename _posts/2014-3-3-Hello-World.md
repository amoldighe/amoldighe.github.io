My objective is to keep this blog simple and informative. I would be posting my experience with various devops technologies that I learn and use daily to solve problem at work or otherwise. As I get time I intent to post weekly.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
