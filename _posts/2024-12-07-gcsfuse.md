### Please note we are doing this process on a NIX based VM, same can be done on Ubuntu/Suse or any Linux flavour, just download the respective gscfuse & google-cloud-sdk package

### Install gcsfuse in current nix environment

nix-env -iA nixos.gcsfuse
```
### Install gcloud sdk in current nix environment
```
nix-env -iA nixos.google-cloud-sdk
```
### Authenticate using gcloud

### Create an Service Account & download the Service Account key

Follow the process mentioned at - [https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create)
