**1. Data Warehouse (DW)**

  
A centralized repository designed for structured data (tables, rows, columns). Optimized for business intelligence (BI), reporting, and analytics.

  

Data type: Structured (relational, transactional, processed).

  

Schema: Schema-on-write (define schema before loading).

  

Cost: Expensive (compute + storage tightly coupled).

  

Use cases: Dashboards, trend analysis, financial reporting.

  

Examples: Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Teradata.

  

**2. Data Lake**

  
A storage system that holds raw data of all types (structured, semi-structured, unstructured). Designed for flexibility and large-scale storage, not optimized for BI directly.

  

Data type: Structured (CSV, Parquet), semi-structured (JSON, XML), unstructured (logs, images, videos).

  

Schema: Schema-on-read (define schema when querying).

  

Cost: Cheaper (storage & compute decoupled).

  

Use cases: Data science, machine learning, big data analytics.

  

Examples: Amazon S3 + Athena, Azure Data Lake Storage, Hadoop HDFS.

  

**3. Data Lakehouse**

  
A hybrid approach that combines the best of both data lakes and warehouses. Stores all data types like a data lake, but supports structured querying and ACID transactions like a warehouse.

  

Data type: All types (structured + unstructured).

  

Schema: Flexible → supports both schema-on-write and schema-on-read.

  

Cost: More cost-effective than DW, scalable like DL.

  

Use cases: BI + ML/AI + advanced analytics in one platform.

  

Examples: Databricks Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, Snowflake (newer versions).
