Prince of Persia, my first memory of using a personal computer, those monochrome 8 bit visuals created a lasting impression. Gaming got me hooked to computers during my school days. Gradually I started exploring gwbasic, C programming during my diploma college, tweaking HIMEM.SYS on DOS/WIN3.11 486 machine to run games, assembling machines for pocket money while in college. Troubleshooting machine issues, operating system issues fueled my curiousity further to explore newer computer hardware, gaming gadgets, mobiles and their operating systems - Symbian OS, Windows Mobile 6.1, Android. I am an Android fanboy since Android Cupcake which I had successfully booted it on my Windows Xperia1 using an HTC ROM. 

On professional front I got introduced to the power of Linux in early 2006 while working for a VFX studio, managing a render farm of 500+ Linux nodes. Linux opened a new avenue of exploration - open source tools, various free operating systems. Over a period of past few years I have worked with some amazing companies, got to be part of awesome Linux development projects, build - manage - train teams across multiple locations. Currently I am working as a Sr Devops Engineer and managing Cloud infrastructure at Reliance JIO, with focus on Openstack, System Deployment, Automation and Solution Delivery.
