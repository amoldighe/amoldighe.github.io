<p>Prince of Persia, my first memory of using a personal computer, those monochrome 8 bit visuals created an everlasting 
print in my memory. Gaming got me hooked to computers during my school days, gradually I started exploring gwbasic, 
C programming during my diploma college, tweaking HIMEM.SYS on DOS/WIN3.11 486 machine to run games, assembling machines 
for pocket money while in college. Troubleshooting hardware, operating system issues fueled my curiousity further to explore newer computer hardware, gaming gadgets, mobiles and their operating systems - Symbian OS, Windows Mobile 6.1, Android. 
I am an Android fanboy since Android Cupcake which I successfully booted it on my Windows Xperia1 using an HTC ROM. </p>

On professional front I got introduced to the power of Linux in early 2006 while managing a render farm of 500+ Linux nodes. Linux opened a whole new avenue of exploration of open source tools, technologies. Over a period of past few years I have worked with some amazing companies, got to be part of awesome Linux development projects, build - manage - train teams across multiple locations. Currently I am working as a Sr Devops Engineer and managing Cloud infrastructure at Reliance JIO, with focus on Openstack, System Deployment, Automation and Solution Delivery.
